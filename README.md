# The landscape of structural variation in aye-ayes (<i>Daubentonia madagascariensis</i>)

Structural variant (SV) calls were manually reviewed using Samplot (Belyeu et al. 2019), a software specifically designed for visual SV validation.


* Supplementary Files (SupTab 6): Sample genotypes at the structural variants with major effects. 
* Supplementary Files (SupTab 7): Sample genotypes at the sites flagged as Mendelian violations.
* Supplementary Files (SupTab 8): Sample genotypes at selected sites without Mendelian violations.
